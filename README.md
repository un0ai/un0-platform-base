# IMPORTANT - react version usage

This repo has 2 branches:
- `main`: uses React 18
- `using-react-19`; uses React 19. This is more modern, but has some errors when installing dependencies and running the first npm install. I can still use it as the page seems to be fully functional regardless of the dependency errors.
