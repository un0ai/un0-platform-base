do the following:
- go through the whole codebase and understand it
- consider the .env file exist but you dont see it
- check the logs to know what's going on
- understand the current db schema in supabase. the query used to create the table is under the supabase directory. READ IT!
- FIX THE requested ISSUE - this is mission critical! do whatever it takes to fix it!
- neither the database schema should change, you need to find a solution without modifying supabase config or settings. THIS WAS WORKING BEFORE WITH THE CURRENT SCHEMA AND CONFIG. BUT YOU UPDATED SOMETHING AND BROKE IT!

issue:
- the user is not able to register via user and password, but is able to do so via google auth. YOU NEED TO FIX THIS
