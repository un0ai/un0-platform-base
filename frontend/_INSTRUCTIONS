first do the following:
- when using shadcn to install packages, use 'shadcn' on the command line instad of 'shadcn-ui', you made this mistake in the past
- go through the whole codebase and understand it
- consider the .env file exist but you dont see it (you can validate the .env file structure using .env.example)- check the logs to know what's going on
- understand the current db schema in supabase. the query used to create the table is under the supabase directory. READ IT!
- always take into consideration that is critical to maintain current functionality regarding login and sign ups both with user and password, and with google. we need this to be always prioritized, maintaining this working is critical!
- never modify the page content of any page not requested in the this prompt, avoid modifying the content of pages if not specifically requested by me.
- be sure not to break the dark/light mode of the site, nor the mode toggle.
- when designing web elements or pages, remember that we use nextjs and shadcn. we need to leverage shadcn components and blocks to build a very nice and pleasing web site.
- the database schema should never change as this is critical for logins, you need to find a solution without modifying supabase config or settings.
- please understand how protected pages work, and avoid breaking this functionality.

your task:
- read the current About page of my project, this is important as you'll be using your understanding of the project in order to create content!
